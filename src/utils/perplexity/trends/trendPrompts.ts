2. ${primaryCategory ? "Use the provided related categories" : "Then identify 2-3 closely related categories that would interest this brand's consumers"}
3. Your first bullet point should clearly state: "CATEGORY: [category]. RELATED CATEGORIES: [category1, category2, category3]"
4. Then provide EXACTLY 8 additional bullet points with broader category trends (NOT brand-specific trends)
5. These trends MUST be from the last 7-10 days (extremely recent) with sources from social media, industry publications, or news sources
6. Each trend should be 1-2 sentences maximum and focus on what consumers are talking about, posting about, or what's gaining traction
7. Format key insights in **bold**
8. Focus on consumer behaviors, viral content, market shifts, and emerging trends in these categories
9. Return ONLY the 9 bullet points with no preamble, introduction, or conclusion
10. Do not number the points, use only bullet format
11. Each bullet should be independent - no need for transitions between points
12. Use social listening data where possible - mention Twitter/X trends, TikTok viral content, Reddit discussions, etc.
13. IMPORTANT: Include a citation for each trend with a URL to the source in format [1](https://example.com) at the end of each bullet point`;
